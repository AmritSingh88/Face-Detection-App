Face Detection App is a simple web-based tool built with Python and Flask that allows users to upload an image and automatically detects faces using the face_recognition library. When a user uploads an image, it’s saved locally and processed to identify the locations of any faces, which are then displayed on the web page. To run Face Detection App, you’ll need Python 3.7+ and pip installed on your computer. Required packages include flask and face_recognition, which can be installed with pip install flask face_recognition. Windows users may also need to install cmake and Visual Studio Build Tools for compatibility. After installation, simply run python app.py and open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser to start detecting faces.
